### Jamming Effectiveness
- **Successfully jammed**: FM radio channels at 104.0 MHz and 106.0 MHz
- **Audio quality**: Clean signal became completely distorted
- **Effective range**: ~1 meter with 24 AWG wire antenna
- **Signal strength**: Sufficient to overpower FM radio reception

## BJT Limitations Analysis

### BF422 Transistor Constraints

#### Frequency Response Limitation
- **Specified range**: Up to ~100 MHz practical operation
- **Theoretical calculation**: 3877.3 MHz from tank circuit
- **Actual achievement**: 100 MHz maximum
- **Limitation factor**: Junction capacitances and gain-bandwidth product

#### Gain-Bandwidth Trade-off
- **At 100 MHz**: Reasonable gain maintained
- **Above 100 MHz**: Gain drops significantly
- **At 3877 MHz**: Insufficient gain for effective amplification

### Impact on Design Goals

#### Cellular Frequency Mismatch
**Modern cellular bands in Bangladesh:**
- 698-806 MHz (4G LTE)
- 1920-1980 MHz (3G/4G uplink)
- 2110-2170 MHz (3G/4G downlink)
- 2500-2690 MHz (4G LTE)

**Project limitation**: 100 MHz << required cellular frequencies

#### Effective Jamming Scope
- **Successfully demonstrated**: FM radio band (88-108 MHz)
- **Cannot jam**: Modern cellular communications
- **Educational value**: Proved concept and circuit operation

### Simulation vs Practical Results
- **PSPICE simulation**: Showed 100 MHz periodic output
- **Practical results**: Matched simulation predictions
- **Model accuracy**: Good correlation between theory and practice

## Hardware Upgrade Requirements

### For Modern Cellular Jamming
To achieve cellular frequency jamming, required upgrades:

#### High-Frequency BJT Options
